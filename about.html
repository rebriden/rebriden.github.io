<div class="history">
   <h1>History</h1>
   <p>When the Abbington Alligators were founded in 1999, the team had only 50 swimmers. Today, the team boasts over 200 swimmers and competes against the top swim clubs in the TSA. Despite the team's rapid growth, our focus has remained the same: to teach kids in our neighborhood the fun of swimming and competitive sports. Our coaches come from a variety of background, many with prior coaching and competitive swim experience. Together with the swim board, our coaches strive to make each season more fun than the last and work hard to teach proper swim technique and competition etiquette.<br><br>For many, the Abbington Alligators swim team is a starting point for young athletes. Our team has produced champions on all levels of competition, including high school, collegiate, and even international meets. If you are looking to get your child involved in competitive sports, you can be sure they will have fun and receive excellent training here in Abbington!

   <div id="faq1">
     <h2>What are the requirements to join the team?</h2>

   </div>
   <div id="faq2">
     <h2>If my child can't swim well, can they still join the team?</h2>
     <p>Yes! No prior swim experience is needed to join. Your child will be placed into a practice group that best fits their skill level and comfort in the water. We are always sure to start each season by teaching or reviewing the different strokes for any new swimmers!</p>
   </div>
   <div id="faq3">
     <h2>My family has plans to travel during the summer, can we still join?</h2>
     <p>Yes! We don't have a minimum number of practices or meets that swimmers must attend, but we encourage you to go to as many as possible. The more practices your child attends, the more they will improve!</p>
   </div>
   <div id="faq4">
     <h2>When is registration?</h2>
     <p>We don't have a date set for registration yet, but it is usually held around late March or early April. We have an in-person option and an online option to register. If you are new to the team, we encourage you to come to in-person registration at the pool so you can meet our staff, pick up a swim suit, and ask questions!</p>

  <h1>How it works</h1>
  <p>If you're new to summer swim team, here's a quick rundown on how it all works!
  <h2>Meets</h2>
  <p>Our season starts with a mock swim meet at our pool in Abbington. This meet allows swimmers to get a feel for what a real swim meet will be like, while also giving coaches a chance to see which strokes are each swimmer's strength. Then, we have 6 swim meets where we compete against other neighborhood teams in the area. 3 of these meets are at home and 3 of them are away. All meets are on Tuesday nights with swimmers arriving around 5pm for warm-ups and the meet starting at 6pm. Most meets last between 4 to 5 hours. Although  meets are not mandatory, we encourage swimmers to attend as many as possible to help score points for our team!</p>
  <h2>Practices</h2>
<p>Below is a sample practice schedule from previous seasons. Morning practices don't start until later in the season to avoid any conflicts with school. Swimmers do not need to attend practice everyday, but to see the most improvement we recommend attending multiple practices a week!</p>
